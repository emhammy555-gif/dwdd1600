    <h1>Achievements</h1>
    <p>At age 18, during her first semester of college, Emily was accepted to her first ever professional, juried art
      gallery. Her two polaroid pieces <em>Leah</em> and <em>Monson</em> were both done in 2020. This kickstarted her
      career as a professional arist.</p>
    <h2>What has she done since?</h2>
    <p>Emily started her art career with high realism, but quickly found it boring. She decided to change up her work and
      focus of drawings and paintings that make people smile.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in seeing more of her work, check out <a href="https://www.embosmem.com" target="_blank">her
