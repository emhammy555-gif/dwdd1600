    <h1>Achievements</h1>
    <p>At age 18, during her first semester of college, Emily was accepted to her first ever professional, juried art gallery. Her two polaroid pieces, <em>Leah</em> and <em>Monson</em>, were both done in 2020. This kickstarted her career as a professional arist.</p>
    <h2>What has she done since?</h2>
    <p>Emily started her art career with high realism, but quickly found it boring. She decided to change up her work and focus on drawings and paintings that make people smile.</p>
