    <h1>About Emily</h1>
    <img src="images/hero.webp" alt="Emily's Cows" width="1024" height="548" class="hero">
    <p>Emily was born in Orem, Utah on June 5th 2002.</p>
    <h2>Where did she start?</h2>
    <p>Growing up, she would trace images and fill in the colors for fun. Sometimes friends would make requests for
      images they wanted recreated.</p>
    <p>It took until she was 16 to start making her own work. She started by experimenting with polaroids. Through this
      experimentation, she made polaroids of her friends. Two of these polaroids would be her first two works in a
      professional gallery.</p>
